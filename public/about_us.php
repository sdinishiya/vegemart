            <br><br>Over centuries, the growth of Farming contributed to the rise of civilizations.
            <br>Farming is the art and science of cultivating the soil, growing crops and raising livestock.
            <br>It includes the preparation of plant products for people to use and their distribution to markets.
            <br>Farming provides most of the world’s food.
            <br>Vegemart is an online shopping portal mainly developed considering the well-being of the farmers of our country, Vegemart allows the farmers to sell their products online and obtain a fair amount for all their harvest.
            <br>This connects the farmer community to our customers to obtain harvest products at a fair price at a standard quality.
            <br> This allows consumers to directly buy goods or services from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app.
            <br>Consumers find a product of interest by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers.
